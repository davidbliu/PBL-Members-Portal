# Webmaster Ideas
 
## reasons for having a webmaster

1. PBL has many dependencies on tech and needs someone to make sure the tools are working.
2. a Webmaster can explore new ways of doing old tasks and improve efficiency
3. a webmaster can help prevent tech gap


__dependencies on tech__

* blog
* tabling
* pbl links
* points and attendance
* wiki + wordpress
* email + notifications

a webmaster can ensure these run smoothly + explore better options for things not in this list. for example

* better permissions on drive
* automate room res
* collect more/better feedback, making PBL more responsive
* design tools for deliberations, 4gen, etc...

__explore new ways of doing old tasks__

The webmaster can be a man on the side thinking of new ideas, even if currently impractical. He/she will be like the dual of vp ops: while one person implements the tried and true ways of running the club the other explores off-path ways to achieve the same goal.

This avoids getting stuck in local optima. Ex: PBL Links and the problem of accessing and discovering resources. Creating and passing hyperlinks is not bad, and emailing/pinning resources for others to find solves the problem. Exploring led to a better solution.

webmaster can act like a tech consultant for PBL.

__reduce tech gap__

* part of responsibility of webmaster is develop/train other webmasters
* have someone who knows how PBL Tech works at all times. (if it is their _job_, then even better)
* never go too long with nobody knowing anything about tech tools
	* as was case with old website
	* tiny semesterly refactoring could have saved it

## needs of a webmaster

* close interaction with stakeholders
	* members who will use the site to improve UX
	* execs who want specific features
	* wasted work/inefficient otherwise
* incentive to develop new tools
	* handing off project to client is unsatisfying
	* hold my babys hand through its childhood years
* safety net
	* evil/dumb webmasters shouldn't be able to destroy working systems
	* access to alumni in the position
	* extensive/established onboarding/training process

## suggestions

webmaster on exec level satisfies both pbls need for webmaster and webmasters needs.

* pbl has someone to maintain + improve software
* pbl has someone to think about how to improve it
* webmaster is connected to pbl
* webmaster can interact easily with stakeholders
* webmaster has incentive to develop tools
* pbl has formal processes to provide webmaster safety net
