# Webmaster Ideas
 
 there are 2 main goals a webmaster could have

__maintain and improve software__

* Its nearly impossible to build software just once
* more of softare's cost is in maintenance than in development
* someone constantly looking at + improving portal ensures we're never too far from unfixable
* its guaranteed something will break at some point
	* ex: the old website
	* written in an old version of rails using old conventions
	* small amounts of refactoring every 1/2 year could have saved it

__explore ways to make the club efficient__

The webmaster can be a man on the side thinking of new ideas, no matter how impractical. He/she will be the dual of VP Ops: while one person implements the tried and true ways of running the club the other explores off-path ways to achieve the same goal.

This is important because its easy to get stuck in local optima. If zombie tag works well one semester, repeating it the next is a cheap way to create an event that doesn't suck. Still, there are a lot of other promising options that could potentially work better. The webmaster can be the exec in charge of exploring those.

Since execs' work can already be distributed across 7 (the current number), adding a person certainly wouldn't increase burden. And since allowing this person to simply explore has a lot of potential to improve the club, it's not a bad idea.

# proposed restructure

* webmaster is an exec on the exec team
	* hard to know what to build without the inside scoop
	* can't oversee how projects are used: removes a lot of the incentive for creating them
	* tech on the exec team
* webmasters job is
	* make sure portal is running. re-deploy at least 1/week.
	* make sure wiki works
	* assist VP Ops in external site (not design, just hosting, tools, etc)
	* manage mailing lists
	* think about ways to improve efficiency
	* train future webmasters
* same expectation to attend events, etc
	* should be someone who cares about club and knows what/how to improve

__logistics__

* announce the position same time as others
* have training for those interested
	* if high demand: increase difficulty until most drop out
	* else: personally find + convince someone 
	* [example: prod.md](./prod.md)
* they can still be expected to speak @ 4gen, voted confidence/no confidence 
	* (they are going to represent PBL at high level)
	* only eligible if completed training
* no chair-->exec requirement for webmaster
	* their passion/involvement will be tested in completing training + speaking at 4gen
